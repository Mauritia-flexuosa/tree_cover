# Tree cover

- The **objective** of this script is to explore tree cover data (<https://data.globalforestwatch.org/documents/tree-cover-gain-2000-2012/explore>) for the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park at the Brazilian Cerrado.

- I compared the tree cover data from Hansen with tree cover measured in the field using a concave densiometer.

- In the end, I mapped tree cover for the entire Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park and surroundings.
